A Simple Hello World API
===

Part of the NodeJS masterclass from Pirple.

My rather stumbling first attempt at a screencast is here https://youtu.be/ZHKLFx5Mlew

Requirements:

- Do not use npm - naked Node only!
- It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 
- When someone sends an HTTP request to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. 

To Run:

- `node index.js`
- open localhost:8080/hello or `curl localhost:8080/hello`
